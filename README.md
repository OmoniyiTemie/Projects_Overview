# PROJECTS OVERVIEW

- SQL Querying and Database Management
- Python Programming
- Data Mining
- Data Visualization
- Data Preparation and Exploration
- Feature Engineering
- Trend Analysis
- Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics 
- Uncovering insights


I used Python programming to carry out data mining, extracting and transforming complex datasets into actionable formats. This enabled effective data preparation and exploration, ensuring accuracy and readiness for analysis. 
 
Through data visualization techniques, I uncovered patterns and trends, enhancing understanding of the underlying data. I performed trend analysis to identify historical and seasonal shifts, providing a foundation for diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. 
 
These methods allowed me to uncover valuable insights, delivering actionable recommendations to address business challenges and drive strategic decisions.

## [PROJECT 3: INCOME IN FOCUS, MAPPING THE U.S. HOUSEHOLD EARNINGS LANDSCAPE](https://github.com/OmoniyiTemie/US_Household_Income)

- Cleaned and preprocessed U.S. household income data using SQL queries, standardized income ranges, and filtered data based on key demographic factors to analyze income distribution.

- Used SQL joins and aggregations to explore regional income disparities, identify trends in income growth, and analyze correlations between income, education, occupation, and geographic location.

- Created complex SQL queries to segment households by income brackets, calculate average income per region, and estimate income distribution across various demographic categories.

- Developed SQL-based data models to identify key determinants of household income variations, segment households using clustering techniques, and generate insights for policy recommendations on income equality.

## [PROJECT 4: GLOBAL LIFE EXPECTANCY PATTERN, EXPLORING THE INTERSECTION OF HEALTH, ECONOMICS, AND DEMOGRAPHICS](https://github.com/OmoniyiTemie/World_Life_Expectancy/tree/main)

- Cleaned the *World Life Expectancy* dataset using SQL, addressing missing values and standardizing country names to maintain data integrity.

- Investigated life expectancy patterns across different regions and countries, leveraging SQL queries to group and aggregate data based on factors such as GDP, healthcare access, and education.

- Integrated demographic, socio-economic, and health datasets through SQL joins, identifying correlations between life expectancy and variables like income, literacy rates, and environmental conditions.

- Developed SQL-based models to pinpoint key factors influencing life expectancy, segment countries by life expectancy categories, and generate actionable insights for improving global health policies.
